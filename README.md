# Plantility

- I am a wannabe "programmer" and "developer" specialized in "developing" things.
- I am pretending to be specialized in "designing" images and logos.
- I created a wannabe "team" called pngBomb, responsible for wannabe "projects" with varieties of fake purposes.
- I am unable to say things without putting dots in the end.
